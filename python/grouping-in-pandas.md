Grouping in Pandas

I was using TimeGrouper, @warmlogic suggests I read this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32147224/how-to-groupby-time-series-by-10-minutes-using-pandas#comment52191817_32148239) comment that links to [the canonical way](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html#grouping-with-a-grouper-specification) to Group in a timeseries. (Mentioning that TimeGrouper is not a public method).
