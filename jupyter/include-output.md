# Why it's sometimes useful to include output in version control


[Riemannian Optimisation with Pymanopt for Inference in MoG models](https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt/blob/master/examples/MoG.ipynb) is probably really cool. I tried to see what it did, so looked at the github file. No output. After about ten more minutes of trying to see what it did I gave up.
